## Poblem Definition
Image Denoising (white and homogeneous Gaussian additive noise)

## Contribution
* Using sparse coding and dictionary to denoise.

* By using K-SVD algorithm, the dictionary describes the image content more effectively.


## Method

### From local to global bayesian reconstruction

## Conclusion
* This method is based on local operations and involves sparse decompositions of each image block under one fixed over-complete dictionary, and a simple average calculations.
